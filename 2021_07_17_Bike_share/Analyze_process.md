Ready first the case study to be sure that we start from the same point. The link for the file used can be found there. 

Cycle bike-share is a company presented in Chicago. Their business is oriented on the location of bikes to individuals.

The company wants to design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

Before doing anything, we should first set the main question which will be the problem to solve :

- How to convert casual riders into annual members ?

To answer it, we should first ask ourself :

- How different are casual riders from annual members ?
- What will make a casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships ?
- How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members ?

To guide us in our analysis, we will use 12 months data collected by our company. The data goes **from 04-2020 to 06-2021.**

# Analyze process #


1. **Load and merge dataset**

   This part is not the most complicated one. Just some knowledge in Python is enough.
   I just write all the files name in a list and store it in a variable. Then i combine `Pandas` and `Loop` to put everything in one file. Then again, store it in a variable (called `df` for me).
2. **Cleaning**

   The first is the most mandatory and important one. Bad input results in bad output.
   Before starting, make a copy of the dataset, do not work with the initial dataset variable. We never know if we need the original dataset afterward (i will work with a dataset stored in `df1` variable.
   
   1. **NaN values**

      `NaN` values break the analyze. It is sometimes a real pain to know what to do with them. Two options :
      - [X] Delete them (`dropna` in `Pandas`)
      - [X] Complete them (using `svd`)
      
      In my case, i drop them because i have more than 4M rows of data.
   3. **data formatting**
      
      Convert your data to the correct type (`number` to `int` format for example).
   
   2. **Check for errors**

      I decide to have a look to all uniques values of each column. I then correct some spelling mistakes.
   
   3. **Delete useless columns or combine them**

      What is useless should be decided case by case. Some examples :
      - [X] Unique value column
      - [X] Redundant details (like `adress` and `id`)

      In my case, i decide to delete `started_at` and `ended_at` but i create a new column called `time` which is just `ended_at - started_at`. Much simpler for later analysis.
      
I then take a quick look at the data to find more mistake.

3. **Analyze**

   First, begin by answering to the first question : **How different are casual riders from annual members ?**
   
   I compute the average time of casual riders and annual members. The output shows that casual riders ride longer time than member riders. I ask myself why result shows that. **Are there outliers ? Clipping ? something else**
   
   I look at the maximum value for the `time` column. An output of 40days of biking was shown. I look again, same. There were more errors than expected and my cleaning part was not done properly. Back to **Point 2**.
   
   ## Think that i clean ##
   
   - [X] negative values
