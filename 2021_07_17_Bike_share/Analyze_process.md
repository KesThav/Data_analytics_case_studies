Hi,

Ready first the case study to be sure that we start from the same point. The link for the file used can be found there.

Explanation of the analyze process :


1. **Load and merge dataset**

   This part is not the most complicated one. Just some knowledge in Python is enough.
   I just write all the files name in a list and store it in a variable. Then i combine `Pandas` and `Loop` to put everything in one file. Then again, store it in a variable (called `df` for me).
3. ldkhflsa
